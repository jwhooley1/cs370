# cs370

Most of this code was suppliedd by SNHU in the course materials for cs370. I wrote the code for a Q-Learning algorithm.

Computer scientists create computational to solve problems such as data processings, modeling, or perform tasks. As a computer scientist when approaching to problems it I like to break down into the most basic parts and figure out how those work together to achieve a goal.
